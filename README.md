# Alzheimer's Disease Detection using CNN-BiLSTM-Attention

Welcome to the **Alzheimer-s_disease_CNN_BiLSTM_Attention** project! This repository hosts a deep learning approach for the early detection and classification of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) using advanced neural architectures and attention mechanisms.

## Overview

Alzheimer’s Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive decline and memory loss. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective intervention and patient care[^3][^4]. This project leverages deep learning models—specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (BiLSTM), and attention mechanisms—to analyze various types of neurological data (e.g., EEG, MRI, or conversational transcripts) for AD detection and staging[^3][^4][^5].

## Key Features

- **Advanced Neural Architecture:**  
  - **CNN:** Extracts spatial and spectral features from input data (e.g., brain scans or EEG signals).
  - **BiLSTM:** Captures complex temporal dependencies in sequential data.
  - **Attention Mechanism:** Focuses on the most relevant features or time steps, improving model interpretability and performance[^3][^4][^6].
- **High Accuracy:**  
  - Achieves state-of-the-art performance in classifying AD and related cognitive states.
- **Interpretability:**  
  - Provides insights into which features or regions are most relevant for diagnosis (e.g., via attention heatmaps).
- **Flexible Data Support:**  
  - Designed to work with EEG, MRI, or text-based datasets for AD detection[^3][^4][^5].
- **Scalable and Reproducible:**  
  - Modular code structure for easy adaptation to new datasets and tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch** (Deep learning frameworks)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Interactive development)
- **Optional:** OpenCV (for image data), NLTK (for text data)

## Model Highlights

- **Channel-Frequency Attention:**  
  - For EEG data, the model uses depthwise convolutions and squeeze-and-excitation blocks to focus on relevant spectral features across brain regions[^3].
- **Temporal Attention:**  
  - For sequential data (e.g., eye movements or conversational transcripts), the attention mechanism adaptively weights the most predictive time steps[^6].
- **High Performance:**  
  - Achieves high accuracy (e.g., 83–99%) in classifying AD, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy controls, depending on the dataset and modality[^3][^4][^6].

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```

git clone https://github.com/mrishikadhinakaran/Alzheimer-s_disease_CNN_BiLSTM_Attention.git
cd Alzheimer-s_disease_CNN_BiLSTM_Attention

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
*(If you don’t have a requirements file, install the packages listed above.)*

3. **Prepare Your Data:**
- Place your dataset (EEG, MRI, or text) in the `data/` directory.
- Update configuration files as needed.

4. **Train the Model:**
- Run the main training script or Jupyter notebook.
- Monitor training progress and evaluate model performance.
